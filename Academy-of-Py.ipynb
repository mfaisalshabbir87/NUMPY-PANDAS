    "Trend 1 - As per the District and School Summary, students are doing better in reading rather than math. But the  overall      passing rate is not very satisfactory for all the schools. Going forward, more attention is required for getting better scores in Math to improve the overall scores and performance of the schools.\n",

Performance in Math: Small and medium size -> 89% - 91% whereas large size -> 67%. This may be due to the reason that the student population in charter schools is less than the district schools."
